# Hi, I'm David H. Cruz

I work in cybersecurity with a focus on understanding systems and improving their security posture.  
I prefer simple, consistent work over anything flashy — small fixes, clear explanations, and reliable processes.

## What I Do

- Perform security assessments on applications and infrastructure  
- Investigate vulnerabilities and help teams remediate them  
- Look into unusual behavior, logs, and potential incidents  
- Write small scripts or workflows to simplify routine security tasks  
- Research attack techniques to better understand how to defend against them

## Currently Exploring

- Cloud security and identity-focused defenses  
- More effective detection engineering  
- Structured approaches to threat modeling and risk analysis
